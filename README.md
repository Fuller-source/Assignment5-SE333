Short Overview
    - My project establishes code quality through automated testing and continuous integration.
        I wrote specification and structural based testing for the BarnsAndNoble project as well as the Amazon project.
        I created a github actions workflow to automatically run the build, static analysis and code coverage on every push to the main branch.
        I wrote both Unit Tests and Integration tests for the Amazon package. My workflow has indeed passed.
        The pipeline indeed produced the required checkstyle and jacoco reports.
